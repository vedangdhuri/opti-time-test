## 📖 About The Project

**Opti-Time** is a powerful Django-based application engineered to solve the NP-hard problem of university timetabling. It automates the complex process of scheduling classes, practical batches, and teacher assignments while strictly adhering to hard constraints and optimizing for soft constraints.

It handles multiple classes (e.g., FYCO, SYCO, TYCO), subject constraints, practical batches (A1, A2, A3), and teacher availability to produce **conflict-free, optimized schedules**.

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                                        |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🤖 Automated Scheduling** | Generates valid timetables for multiple classes simultaneously with a single click.                                |
| **⚡ Conflict Detection**   | Real-time validation ensures no teacher or room is double-booked across different classes.                         |
| **🧪 Batch Management**     | Automatically handles practical sessions for distinct batches (A1, A2, A3) ensuring unique teacher assignments.    |
| **⚖️ Smart Allocation**     | Prioritizes practicals (2hr blocks), distributes theory lectures evenly (Max 2/day), and fills gaps intelligently. |
| **📈 Global Analytics**     | Dedicated institutional-level dashboards to holistically view overall validations, workload, and conflicts.        |
| **📊 Class Dashboard**      | Visualizes per-class workload distribution to identify underloaded or overloaded resources.                        |
| **🔄 Dynamic Regeneration** | Seamlessly regenerate the timetable with a single click to explore and refine scheduling alternatives.             |

## 🧠 Algorithm Logic

The core of **Opti-Time** operates on a **Constrained-Based Randomized Heuristic Algorithm**. It approaches the scheduling problem in distinct, logical phases:

1.  **🧬 Phase 1: Practical Scheduling (Hard Constraint)**
    - Uses `itertools.product` to generate valid combinations of practical subjects for batches (A1, A2, A3).
    - **Constraint**: All three teachers in a combined practical slot _must_ be unique.
    - **Cross-Check**: Verifies teacher availability against other classes (e.g., Is the teacher busy in TYCO while needed for SYCO?).

2.  **🕗 Phase 2: Theory Scheduling**
    - Iterates through available time slots.
    - Selects subjects from a weighted pool.
    - **Constraints**:
      - **Teacher Availability**: Checks against all other generated timetables.
      - **Daily Load**: Limits a subject to a maximum of 2 lectures per day.

3.  **🔄 Phase 3: Gap Filling & Optimization**
    - Scans for remaining empty slots.
    - Assigns "Extra" lectures or "Library" slots if no teachers are available, ensuring a complete schedule.
